## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Full local persistence under plain Node.** A runtime-agnostic `@tila/backend-embedded` core (`EmbeddedProject` + `BlobStore` seam + shared `EMBEDDED_MIGRATIONS`) now backs local mode for the CLI (Bun via `bun:sqlite`) **and** the TypeScript SDK + MCP server (plain Node via `better-sqlite3`). See `docs/02-ARCHITECTURE.md` §1.6a.
- **`createTila` SDK facade** — one uniform resource-method surface over both the local (in-process SQLite) and cloudflare (HTTP) backends; swap `config.backend` without changing call sites. `tila-sdk/local` exposes `createTilaLocal` for direct local use. `better-sqlite3` is an optional peer dependency (range `>=11 <13`; CI-tested on 12.x).
- **MCP server local mode** (`backend = "local"`) — runs under plain Node, configured via `TILA_DB_PATH` / `TILA_ARTIFACTS_PATH` / `TILA_ORG` (precedence: config value > env > default; `org` defaults to the OS username).

### Changed

- **Records now work in local mode** across the CLI, SDK, and MCP — previously remote-only.
- **Local-mode artifact `put` now honors `kind` / `resource` / `fence`.** The old `LocalArtifactBackend` silently dropped them.
- **`record types` is consistently in-use-only** across local and remote (`listRecordTypesInUse`). The CLI `record types` (no flag) composes the merged declared∪in-use view; `--in-use` shows in-use only.

### Fixed

- **`entityOps.list` `dataFilter` `json_extract` comparison** (production DO bug): server-side `?status=` / `?parent=` entity filtering in the Durable Object returned an empty list because JSON scalar values were not normalized to what `json_extract` returns. Now correct and covered by tests.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

First public release.

### Added

- Content-addressed artifact storage (R2, sha256-keyed, deduplicated) with FTS5 full-text search and server-side grep
- Typed, schema-validated records with revision history and fencing tokens
- Coordination primitives: claims, gates, signals, presence, and an append-only journal
- First-writer-wins concurrency with monotonic fencing tokens (stale writes rejected)
- Cloudflare deployment path (Worker + Durable Object SQLite + D1 + R2) and local mode (`tila init --local`, bun:sqlite)
- `tila` CLI distributed as self-contained native binaries for macOS, Linux (glibc + musl), and Windows
- TypeScript SDK (`tila-sdk`) and MCP server (`tila-mcp-server`) for Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code
- Read-only dashboard SPA served by the Worker
- GitHub-scoped authentication (default) and D1 API tokens (admin)
